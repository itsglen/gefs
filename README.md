## Setup

Building assumes a Windows environment with GCC-64 installed. If targeting the `GLFW` platform layer, you'll need add the vendored resources in `/vend` to their respective folders in your GCC compiler.

Once completed you can execute the build scripts with `shell`

```bash
sh glfw_build.sh
```
